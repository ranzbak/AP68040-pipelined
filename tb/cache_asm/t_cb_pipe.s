; t_cb_pipe.s - findings/copyback/plan.md S0: the copyback data cache.
; Translation on, 4K identity pages; the work pages are copyback (CM=01).
; Memory behind the caches is read through the bench's peek registers
; ($F190 address, $F192 the longword), on a cache-inhibited page.  With
; COPYBACK ($F196 = 1) a store hit stays in the cache until it is pushed;
; without it every store writes through, and the program checks that too:
; only case 1's first peek depends on the mode.  Runs under
; tb_ap040_pipe_compat.v.  Protocol: $F100 = failing check, $F102 = $600D.
;
;  pages: 0-1 code (CM=00), 2-3 work (copyback), 4 = physical page 2,
;  cache-inhibited (the alias), 5 tables (CM=00), 6-7 stack (CM=00),
;  8 code written through copyback, 9 write-through work, F registers (CI)
;
;   1  a store hit: memory unchanged until CPUSHA (copyback), then new
;   2  eviction: four more lines in the set push the dirty one
;   3  CINVA over a dirty line writes it back (plan revision 3)
;   4  a misaligned store over a dirty line: memory and cache agree
;   5  a cache-inhibited read (the alias) of a dirty line sees the store
;   6  MOVE16 from a dirty line
;   7  a DMA write to another line of a dirty line's set keeps the line
;   8  code stored through copyback runs after CPUSHA
;   9  a write-through page writes through
;  10  a store miss writes through (no write-allocate)
;  11  all four ways of one set dirty ($2080/$2480/$2880/$2C80), CPUSHA
;      writes every one back
;  12  three ways of one set dirty ($2090/$2490/$2890), then a
;      cache-inhibited read in that set: every dirty way written back first
;  13  MOVE16 of a whole line, four different longwords: from a dirty
;      copyback line ($20A0 -> $30A0) and from a write-through line
;      ($90A0 -> $90C0), every longword in its place
