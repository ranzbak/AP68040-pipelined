# AP68040-pipelined

A pipelined MC68040-compatible CPU core in Verilog/SystemVerilog, with MMU,
FPU and split instruction/data caches, integrated into
[MinimigAGA_TC64](https://github.com/ranzbak/MinimigAGA_TC64) (QMTech
XC7A100T). It is a fork of [AP68040](https://github.com/nonarkitten/AP68040):
the pipelined branch completed, verified and brought up on hardware.

## Credits

- **Adam Polkosnik** wrote AP68040, the original sequential 68040 core with its
  MMU, FPU, caches and test benches, as part of
  [Minimig-AGA_MiSTer](https://github.com/apolkosnik/Minimig-AGA_MiSTer). He
  holds the copyright on that work, and most of `rtl/compat/` and `rtl_old/`
  is his.
- **Renee Cousins (nonarkitten)** started the six-stage pipelined core in
  `rtl/`.
- **Paul Honig** completed the pipelined core (the full integer ISA, exceptions,
  MMU, FPU, split read paths and timing closure) and its Minimig integration.

## Status

- Six stages, as on the real 68040: IF, ID, EA-calc, EA-fetch, EX, WB.
- Hardware (QMTech XC7A100T, MinimigAGA_TC64): boots Kickstart 3.1.4 to
  Workbench, and cputest `ct040_01` passes. The wider board test campaign is
  still in progress.
- Simulation: `tb/run_pipe_tests.sh` passes all legs with the board's switches
  (324, or 328 with `PIPE_COPYBACK=1`; October 2026). WinUAE cputest
  Basic 670/670 plus six further groups. Kickstart 3.1.4 boots in the
  differential bench against the original core.
- Split instruction/data read paths (plan M14): a cache hit is answered the
  clock after it is issued. Measured at about 2.1x the previous throughput on
  SysInfo's loop in the SoC bench.
- FPU: the 68040's hardware subset. Unimplemented instructions trap as on a
  real 68040 and need an FPSP (for example `68040.library`).

The milestone log, open questions and every deviation from the manual are in
`AP040_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and `TIMING-LOG.md`.

## Performance

Measured on the board (QMTech XC7A100T in MinimigAGA_TC64), with the core
clocked at **37.8125 MHz** (`clk_114/3`), the MMU on under MMULib's
`68040.library`, the FPU on, and the Minimig's fast RAM (Zorro II/III SDRAM
and the DDR3 board). The benchmark is
[xSysInfo](https://github.com/reinauer/xSysInfo)'s Dhrystone 2.1, which rates
against an A4000/040 at 25 MHz.

| Core | Dhrystones/s | vs 68040 @ 25 MHz |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| before the store buffer and branch work | 21,721 | 0.66 |
| + store buffer, store-to-load forwarding, return-address stack | 22,185 | 0.67 |
| + address-precise fast reads | 28,938 | 0.88 |
| + stores posted with the MMU on | 33,287 | 1.01 |
| + forward branches guessed not taken (release 0.1) | 36,256 | 1.10 |
| + late-operand load dispatch | 37,316 | 1.13 |
| + copyback data cache (DDR3 fast RAM set to CopyBack) | 41,656 | 1.26 |
| **+ misaligned accesses served from the data cache (current main)** | **47,413** | **1.44** |
| + write-allocate on a copyback store miss (prototype, in development) | 49,444 | 1.50 |

With write-allocate that is about 1,310 Dhrystones/s per MHz (0.74
DMIPS/MHz), against about 1,320 for a real 68040: about 99 % of the real
chip per clock, and 1.5x a 25 MHz 68040 by running at 38 MHz (the current
main, 47,413: about 1,250 per MHz). The last three rows need the fast RAM
marked CopyBack in the MMU configuration (MMULib); in write-through the
copyback hardware stores through like the earlier rows. The write-allocate
row was measured on a prototype board image; the parameter (AP040_WALLOC)
lands on main once its tests are complete.

The features behind the table are parameters of `ap040_pipe_tg68k_compat`,
all 0 (off) by default:

| Parameter | What it does | MinimigAGA_TC64 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AP040_STORE_BUF` | posts stores that cannot fault into a 4-entry FIFO (1) | 1 |
| `AP040_FWD` | a load an older store covers is answered from that store | 1 |
| `AP040_RAS` | an 8-entry return-address stack predicts RTS in ID | 1 |
| `AP040_PRECISE` | fast reads compare addresses with the stores in flight, instead of waiting for all of them | 1 |
| `AP040_SB_MMU` | with translation on, stores to a page a synchronous store proved writable are posted too | 1 |
| `AP040_BTFN` | ID guesses a forward conditional branch not taken | 1 |
| `AP040_LDX` | an eligible load goes to EX in the clock it is looked up | 1 |
| `AP040_COPYBACK` | the data cache keeps stores to CM = 01 pages (copyback), DDR3 board only | 1 |
| `AP040_DFP_MIS` | a misaligned access inside a 4K page is served from (or fills, or merges into) the data cache | 1 |
| `AP040_BTB` | IF's branch target buffer | 0 |
| `AP040_MISPLIT` | splits misaligned transfers into aligned pieces | 0 |

With the MMU on, `AP040_SB_MMU` posts only into the DDR3 board's window
(`mem_postok` in `ap040_pipe_tg68k_compat.v`): posting into the SDRAM as well
corrupted data on the board while every simulation passed, and that cause is
still open. `AP040_MISPLIT` gains nothing on the board and is not used;
`AP040_DFP_MIS` replaces it.

## Integrating it

**Files.** Add `rtl/ap040_pipe_pkg.sv` first, then every `rtl/ap040_*.v` and
every `rtl/compat/*.v` (plus `rtl/compat/primitives/*.v`), all as
SystemVerilog, with `rtl/` and `rtl/compat/` on the include path. The Quartus
`rtl/ap040_pipe.qip` is out of date; use the file list above, or copy
`tools/vivado/build_ap040.tcl` from MinimigAGA_TC64, which does exactly this
when `AP040_PIPE_DIR` points at this repository. Don't add `rtl_old/` to
the same project: some module names clash.

**Top level: `ap040_pipe_tg68k_compat`.**

```verilog
ap040_pipe_tg68k_compat #(
    .AP040_HAS_MMU     (1),   // 0: LC040 without MMU
    .AP040_HAS_FPU     (0),   // 1: FPU on (about +11k LUTs on Artix-7)
    .AP040_ENABLE_CACHE(1),
    .AP040_IFP         (1),   // M14 fast read paths (needs the cache)
    .AP040_BUS16       (0)    // 0: 32-bit m_* master port; 1: 16-bit host bus
) cpu (
    .clk (clk_cpu), .nreset (nreset), .clkena_in (1'b1),
    .ipl (ipl), .ipl_autovector (1'b1), .berr (berr), .nresetout (nresetout),
    .m_req (m_req), .m_write (m_write), .m_instr (m_instr), .m_size (m_size),
    .m_addr (m_addr), .m_wdata (m_wdata), .m_fc (m_fc),
    .m_ack (m_ack), .m_rdata (m_rdata),
    ...
);
```

**Port groups.**
- **`m_*`** (with `AP040_BUS16=0`): one 32-bit request at a time, fields
  stable while `m_req` is high, answered by `m_ack`. This is the mode
  MinimigAGA_TC64 uses, where `rtl/soc/TG68K.vhd` bridges it to SDRAM, DDR3
  and the chipset across clock domains. With `AP040_BUS16=1` the core talks
  to a TG68K-style 16-bit bus (`data_in`, `addr_out`, `busstate`, ...)
  instead.
- **`walker_*`**: the MMU table walker's own memory port. A walk that never
  gets `walker_ack` becomes a bus error; it never hangs the core.
- **`cache_snoop_*`**: DMA write snoop, already in the core's clock domain.
  Without it the data cache can't see writes from other bus masters.
  `cache_z2_*`/`cache_z3_*` describe the cacheable windows, and
  `cache_allow_all` bypasses them for flat simulation.
- **`fill_*`, `cache_maint_*`, `cache_req/…`**: line fills and cache
  maintenance, for a wrapper that serves them. Tie them off otherwise.
- **`mmu_*`, `cacr_out`, `vbr_out`, `debug_*`**: observation only.

**Things to get right.**
- It is a **restart-model** 68040: a faulting write is re-executed after the
  handler fixes the mapping, and the access-error frame never advertises a
  valid WB3.
- Timing on Artix-7 (speed grade -2) is closed at 38 MHz (`clk_114/3` in the
  Minimig build) with the FPU on. The critical paths are the memory
  acknowledge into the pipeline's stall chain; see `TIMING-LOG.md`.
- `primitives/dpram.v` is an inferred true-dual-port RAM. Swap in a vendor
  macro if your flow needs one.

## Testing

```
cd tb && ./run_pipe_tests.sh     # the pipelined core; needs iverilog only
cd tb && ./run_tests.sh          # rtl_old; also needs vasmm68k_mot (vbcc)
```

Every bench runs against the core alone, so a failure is the CPU's, not an
integration artifact. The benches that co-simulate the core with the Amiga
chipset, the SDRAM and DDR3 controllers, Kickstart, and the WinUAE cputest
corpus live in MinimigAGA_TC64 (`sim/ddr3_cpu`), because they need those
modules. vvp is single-threaded, so independent benches can run in parallel.

Order of authority when sources disagree: the M68040 User's Manual text, then
a source verified on real 68040 hardware for that case (such as WinUAE's
cputest-validated 040 code), then the Programmer's Reference Manual. Each
decision is recorded in the plan's divergences table.
